                <h3>REVOLUTIONIZING NODES RUNNING WITH PROOF-OF-UPTIME</h3>
                <p>Bithereumâ€™s answer to todays full node issues. PoU is a full node incentive initiative that allows users running a node to either earn rewards with no existing balance, or stake their holdings to earn additional BTH. Simply put, being a BTH node runner is like mining without the need for expensive hardware and high energy costs, while also still generating rewards. A network can never have too many nodes and Bithereum aims to boast one of the strongest full node networks in all of crypto.</p>
